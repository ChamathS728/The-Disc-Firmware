List of things that need to be changed for Disc V2

- Flip MCU and Differential-2-SingleEnded transceiver to top of board
- Replace arming switch connectors for AB and MC with 2 pin horizontal
- Add thermal reliefs onto GND pads for solderability
- Space passives around D5 component further out
- Potentially use different package PMOS-FET for reverse polarity protection
    - Alternatively, increase pad size for hand soldering
- Consider flipping board shape to work with mechanical assembly
- Redundant power supply setup???
    - Probably unnecessary, but it would add a significant amount of work
- Add keepout near all mounting holes, large enough for a matching nut
- Consider rerouting encoder timer and PWM timer pins
    - Swap which timers each pin on the DRV/Encoder go to, to use repetition counter for PWM
- Break out any extra I/O into another molex connector elsewhere
- Replace fuse with properly rated one
- Commit to differential encoder, so ditch the single-ended option
- Consider using 64 pin package STM instead of 48
- Do some passives optimisation to reduce number of parts assembled from JLC
    - Also buy more stuff from LCSC where possible I suppose
- Switch placement of BATT IN and AB arming inputs
    - Whatever to make routing cleaner
- Move Strelka V2 SPI connector
    - Make it 90 deg (or 0 whatever) so that it is parallel to motor mount silkscreen
    - Push it closer-ish to motor mount and maybe add extra cutouts to make the board symmetrical
